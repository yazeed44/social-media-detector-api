# social-media-detector-api


API for reporting social media accounts linked to a phone number. For example, the API could take a phone number as an input and outputs ”This phone number has Telegram, Whatsapp, Twitter tied to it but not Instagram”. We can scale this to tens, hundreds, thousands of phone numbers which makes it a very useful tool for collecting information about a large sample of people.

The API can also be used in command line and makes it possible to integrate every programming language that has access to operating system command line. Which is pretty much all of them. so that we’re not tied to only python.
